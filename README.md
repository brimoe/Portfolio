# Welcome to my Portfolio! (◕‿◕✿)

## About Me:
Hi, My name is Briana Moses 🙋🏾‍♀️ . I am a recent college graduate with a B.A. in psychology. After taking a statistics analytics course as an elective during my last semester of university, I became captivated by the numerous things one can do with just analyzing data. Thus completing my undergrad degree during the coronavirus pandemic, I used quarantine as self-motivation to enhance my technical and analytical skills to pursue a career as a data analyst.
