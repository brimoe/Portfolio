# Welcome to my Portfolio (◕‿◕✿)

## About Me:
Hi, My name is Briana Moses. I am a recent college graduate with a B.A. in psychology. After taking a statistics analytics course as an elective during my last semester of university, I became captivated by the numerous things one can do with just analyzing data. Thus completing my undergrad degree during the coronavirus pandemic, I used quarantine as self-motivation to enhance my technical and analytical skills to pursue a career as a data analyst. 

## Projects:
Data Analytics has become an instant passion for me on how inquisitive and influential data can be. I love a good story, and data analysis is all about telling and showcasing a good story. This portfolio is a progressive collection of all the projects I've completed while displaying my growth and devotion to improving my analytical and technical skills. In this portfolio, I used various functionalities required to analyze and visualize my data:
* SQL
* Python
* R
* Excel
* Tableau
* Power BI

My data projects below will showcase what I've accomplished by learning data science and data analytics for educational and professional purposes. I am devoted to expanding my knowledge and eager to contribute my skills in a professional setting. \ (•◡•) /

### Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews
Language: Python

In this project, I produced a sentiment analysis covering over 500,00 reviews from Amazon Fine Food. I classified positive and negative customer reviews with this large dataset and displayed my analysis using plotly visualizations, word clouds, and machine learning.

This analysis features technical functions such as pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, word cloud, nltk, sklearn, Multinominal Naive Bayes Model.

### Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto 
Language: Python

For this data project, I segmented and clustered the neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada, based on postal code and district information found from an open data source. Then, I generated a folium map to visualize the communities and how they cluster together.

This analysis features technical functions such as pandas, beautiful soup, NumPy, nominatim, json_normalize, and folium.

### Battle of the Neighborhoods Capstone Project
Language: Python

This project is a comprehensive analysis report for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project. In this capstone, I will create a problem for a group of people and then use Foursquare location data to solve it.

This analysis features technical functions such as pandas, NumPy, nominatim,  folium, and Foursquare API.
