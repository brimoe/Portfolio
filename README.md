# Welcome to my Portfolio! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

## About Me:
Hi, My name is Briana Moses. I am a recent college graduate with a B.A. in psychology. After taking a statistics analytics course as an elective during my last semester of university, I became captivated by the numerous things one can do with just analyzing data. Thus completing my undergrad degree during COVID-19, I used quarantine as self-motivation to enhance my technical and analytical skills to pursue a career as a data analyst.

## Projects:
Data Analytics has become an instant passion for me on how inquisitive and influential data can be. I love a good story, and data analysis is all about telling and showcasing a good story. This portfolio is a progressive collection of all the projects I've completed while displaying my growth and devotion to improving my analytical and technical skills. In this portfolio, I used various functionalities required to analyze and visualize my data:
* SQL
* Python
* R
* Tableau

My data projects below will showcase what I've accomplished by learning data science and data analytics for educational and professional purposes. I am devoted to expanding my knowledge and eager to contribute my skills in a professional setting. \ (â€¢â—¡â€¢) /



### ðŸ“Š [Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/brimoe/Portfolio/blob/eaeb775b07649791db2ded0693da463b1158c818/Sentiment_Amazon_Analysis.pdf)
Language: Python

In this project, I produced a sentiment analysis covering over 500,000 reviews from Amazon Fine Food Reviews [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?select=Reviews.csv). I classified positive and negative customer reviews with this large dataset and displayed my analysis using plotly visualizations, word clouds, and machine learning.

This analysis features technical functions such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `word cloud`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, and `Multinominal Naive Bayes Model`.

### ðŸ“Š [Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brimoe/Portfolio/blob/main/Segmenting%20and%20Clustering%20Neighborhoods%20in%20Toronto%20%281%29.ipynb) 
Language: Python

For this data project, I segmented and clustered the neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada, based on postal code and district information found from an open data source. Then, I generated a folium map to visualize the communities and how they cluster together.

This analysis features technical functions such as `pandas`, `beautiful soup`, `numpy`, `nominatim`, `json_normalize`, and `folium`.

### ðŸ“Š [Battle of the Neighborhoods Capstone Project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/5f0c3d1c-396a-4555-b9f5-2c7e0482b10e/view?access_token=c20feba44814fd74935a511af0ad6176a2943983942271d0a7cfa579df4c4539)
Language: Python

This project is a comprehensive analysis report for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project. In this capstone, I created a problem for a group of people and then use Foursquare location data to solve it.

This analysis features technical functions such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `nominatim`,  `folium`, and Foursquare API.
